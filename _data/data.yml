career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a mechanical engineering candidate with a specialization in mechanical design. I possess particular expertise in the use of Python and open-source libraries for the design and validation of mechanical structures, which I have applied to my master's project. 

      My experience includes mechanical design of composite structures, manufacturing processes, tooling and machine element design. Additionally, I have a strong understanding of cable mechanics, which I acquired as part of my master's research.
